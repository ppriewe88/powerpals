# powerpals
Contains my first python project - a 2D-rpg (role play game) where you wander a small map encountering enemies and fighting round based fights. Python, terminal-based. Lots of fun!

To play the game, import project files in a single root:
- class_powerpal.py
- class_wanderer.py
- console.py
- helpers.py
- main.py
- map.py
- powerpal_art.py 

Start main.py. Best, start in terminal directly (running in console does not allow "static" UI, as screen clearing functions are not available there).
For the gameplay, you will find all the instructions in the game itself!

Enjoy playing!

If you prefer to have a rather high level impression of the project, check out the project documentation or the gameplay flowchart!

Best,
Patrick

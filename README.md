# PowerPals

Contains my first Python project â€“ a 2D-RPG (role-playing game) where you wander a small map, encountering enemies and fighting round-based battles. Python, terminal-based. Lots of fun!  

## How to Play  

To play the game, import all project files into a single root directory:  

- `class_powerpal.py`  
- `class_wanderer.py`  
- `console.py`  
- `helpers.py`  
- `main.py`  
- `map.py`  
- `powerpal_art.py`  

Start `main.py`.  
**Tip:** It's best to run it directly in the terminal, as running in a console does not allow a "static" UI (screen clearing functions are not available there).  

## Gameplay  

You'll find all instructions within the game itself. Enjoy playing!  

## Additional Information  

If you prefer a high-level impression of the project, check out the **project documentation** or the **gameplay flowchart**.  

ðŸ‘‰ **There is also a short DEMO VIDEO available! Easy to find, have a look!**  

Best,
